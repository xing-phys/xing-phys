- 👋 Hi, I’m @xing-phys
- 👀 I’m interested in Condensed matter physics, the dynamics of non-equilibrium quantum systems (say, open quantum systems) and non-Hermitian systems
- 🌱 I’m currently learning some tensor network algorithms
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... anything that is beneficial to my career
- 📫 I am now in the T01 group of the Institute of Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences
